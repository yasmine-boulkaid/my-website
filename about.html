        <h1>about</h1>
        <p>hi! my name is yasmine, i am 25 years old and i decided to teach myself web design for fun! this website is a way for me to practise what i have learnt whilst also sharing a bit about myself to the world :) (i was too young to have a myspace page sniff) </p>
        <p>this year was a special year for me. you see it was the first year since i entered kindergarten where i did not have to go to school! i had completed all of my classes by december 2024, which means that i started the year as a free woman. </p>
        <p>i went to a a french high school and a french engineering school which means i had classes from 8am to 6pm almost everyday, and at least one exam per week. to say i was exhausted would be quite an understatement. with the newly found free time graduating brought me, i was able to reconnect with hobbies i have had to leave behind throughout the years, namely watching movies, reading books, and travelling.</p>
        <h2><a href="about.html">movies</a></h2>
            <p>well, to be completely honest, watching movies had never been a hobby of mine, more like something i always wanted to do more of. think of a movie. any movie. i probably haven't watched it. worse than that, i would systematically fall alseep when trying to watch a movie, be it at home, at the cinema, alone or with friends. for a moment i thought i might be ill or have some sort of nutritional deficiency. i now realize i was just constantly tired. with my newly found free time and energy i started going to the cinema more and more and i even logged every single movie i have watched this year. </p>
        <h2><a href="about.html">books</a></h2>
            <p>when i was younger i was such an avid reader. i wouldn't leave the house, or even my room, without a book. and then one day i just stopped reading. years later, when i tried to read a book again, i couldn't go through the first page without falling asleep (remember what i told you about being exhausted?). this year, i started buying paperback copies of short books (300 pages max) and carrying them around in my backpocket. this resulted in me having read more books this year than i have in the past 10 years combined (probably).</p>
        <h2><a href="about.html">travel</a></h2>
            <p>finally, travelling. to be honest, this never stopped being a hobby for me and i am lucky to have visited a lot of places throughout the years. but this only meant that with more free time (and a humble but non-negligeable intern salary), i seized every opportunity i could grasp to go away.</p>
